Description
GTAsust
The proposed project is a game set within the confines of the SUST campus, designed to enable a vehicle's movement from one location to another based on user commands. The game initiates with the representation of a vehicle denoted by the symbol '@'. Users are tasked with maneuvering this vehicle across the campus to reach a designated destination using directional commands: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, facilitated by the arrow keys on the keyboard. The game concludes upon the successful arrival of the vehicle at the user's chosen destination.<br>
Gameplay:
The central element of the game is the '@' symbol, symbolising the vehicle. Users begin at a predefined location, specifically the SUST Gate, and are allocated four moves to navigate the vehicle. The four directional movements are associated with the arrow keys of the keyboard: UP for upward movement, DOWN for downward movement, LEFT for leftward movement, and RIGHT for rightward movement. With every input, the vehicle advances by one unit in the specified direction. The game concludes once the vehicle reaches the desired location within the campus.
Target of the project:
The primary focus of this project centres on the development of a functional map. Serving as a miniature representation of the SUST campus, the map illustrates pathways between various points and aids in determining the number of feasible routes to reach a specific destination. Its functionality extends to assisting users in determining the shortest path between two locations within the campus premises.
